        My grandmother's old-fashioned hamburger casserole is comfort food at its
        best! Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this
        simple recipe dates back to the 1940's. I've tweaked the amount of cheese
        and sour cream depending on what I've got in the fridge and it always
        turns out great! My mother has suggested this was made up as a way to use
        up ingredients in the fridge.

    <h3>Ground Beef Casserole Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ground Beef
            <p>
                Of course, you'll need ground beef for this casserole. The recipe
                calls for about one pound.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Tomato Sauce
            <p>
                Canned tomato sauce adds flavor and helps bring the casserole
                together.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Seasoning
            <p>
                White sugar, salt, and garlic salt are used to add flavor to the
                tomato sauce.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Pasta
            <p>
                Egg noodles work best for this old-fashioned ground beef casserole,
                but you can substitute whatever noodles you have on hand.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sour Cream and Cream Cheese
            <p>
                Sour cream and cream cheese make the casserole extra rich and creamy.
                Plus, they add a bit of pleasant tang.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Onion
            <p>A diced white onion kicks the flavor and texture up a notch.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheddar Cheese
            <p>
                Shredded Cheddar cheese is sprinkled on top of the casserole to create
                a decadent finish. You could also use shredded Monterey Jack to turn
                the heat up a notch.
            </p>

    <h3>How to Make Ground Beef Casserole</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cook and Season the Ground Beef
            <p>
                Cook the beef in a skillet over medium-high heat until it's brown and
                crumbly. Drain and discard the grease. Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic
                salt, and salt into the ground beef and simmer until the flavors
                blend. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook Egg Noodles
            <p>
                Boil the egg noodles until they're cooked through, but are still quite
                firm. Drain in a colander and allow to cool slightly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix Sour Cream and Cream Cheese
            <p>
                Mix the sour cream, cream cheese, and diced onion in a medium bowl
                until well-combined.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble and Bake
            <p>
                Layer half of the egg noodles into a greased casserole dish. Top with
                half of the sour cream mixture, then half of the beef mixture. Repeat
                in the same order. Sprinkle the top layer of beef with cheese. Bake
                until the cheese is melted and golden, about 25-30 minutes.
