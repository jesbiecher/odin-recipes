    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Step 1
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 2
            <p>
                Cook ground beef and onions in a skillet over medium heat until beef is browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain grease. Stir in water and taco seasoning; cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 2 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 3
            <p>
                Reduce heat to low and add refried beans, olives, green chiles, and salsa. Cook and stir until ingredients are warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 4
            <p>
                Place 1/2 of the broken taco shells in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour in 1/2 of the ground beef mixture, then sprinkle 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over top. Repeat layers once more.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 5
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes.
